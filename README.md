# 64 tap 16 bit FIR filter
This is a 64 tap 16 point serial FIR filter based on Distrubuted arithmetic(DA).  
There are also gate level files, and python for generating LUT and test result.   

## Building Blocks
  Dual-clock FIFO (with designer-specified depth)    
  Fixed-point ALU(Design/employ distributed arithmetic hardware to perform the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC))     
  Register file

Testbench:    
  Provide input at clk1      
  Provide clk1 and clk2      
  The spec for clk1 is 10 kHz   
  that for clk2 is designer-specified
